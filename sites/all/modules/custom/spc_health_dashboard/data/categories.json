        "description": "Thirteen of the 21 PICTs included in this report have a current national multisectoral strategy addressing NCDs and risk factors, 15 have established NCD indicators and targets, and five have an active multisectoral NCD taskforce. Substantial efforts are required to strengthen leadership and governance of NCDs in PICTs. The NCD crisis is driven by multiple factors, both within and outside the health sector, so a multisectoral approach is essential to address this issue. Pacific health ministers have already committed to taking a multisectoral approach to address NCDs. Establishing a multisectoral NCD strategy with target indicators and taskforces are essential activities to operationalise this commitment.",

However, only six PICTs have regulations governing alcohol advertising. Nineteen PICTs have alcohol taxation mechanisms in place but, in most cases, taxation is based on beverage type, rather than on ethanol content, the recommended mechanism for discouraging consumption of beverages with high ethanol content, thereby reducing alcohol-related harm. Based on findings from this report, there are two key areas where very few PICTs have an established alcohol policy: alcohol taxation based on ethanol content, and regulating alcohol advertising.",

Thirteen PICTs have fiscal policies in place to make healthy food choices easier and cheaper and to discourage unhealthy food choices, but only four PICTs were rated as having ‘strong’ (i.e. three-star rating) measures in place. Thirteen PICTs have national food-based dietary guidelines for adults. No PICTs have policies or legislation to limit trans-fats in the food supply. In terms of actions to encourage healthy eating among children, only two PICTs have policies in place to restrict marketing of unhealthy food to children, and 11 PICTs have policies or guidelines encouraging healthy food services in schools. Based on findings from this report, there are two key areas where very few PICTs have established policy: limiting trans-fats and restricting marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Banning transfats is recommended by WHO as a cost-effective intervention, given the evidence that eliminating trans-fats from the food supply is expected to impact directly on cardiovascular disease mortality. The Report of Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity recommends implementing the Set of Recommendations on the Marketing of Foods and Non-alcoholic Beverages to Children16 to reduce the power of the marketing of unhealthy foods and the exposure of children and adolescents to it. Further work on other areas of food policy is also critical.",

Fifteen PICTs have included all essential NCD medicines in the national list of essential medicines and have systems in place to ensure their availability. Smoking cessation support of some kind is available in 15 PICTs. Regarding programmes related to infant nutrition, seven PICTs have restrictions on the marketing of breast milk substitutes, six have a public hospital certified as a baby-friendly hospital, and eight provide at least 12 weeks paid maternity leave. Based on findings from this report, there are three key areas where very few PICTs have an established policy: restricting marketing of breast milk substitutes, baby-friendly hospitals accreditation, and provisionof paid maternity leave and breastfeeding breaks and facilities. Action in these areas are identified by  the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity as key strategies to address childhood obesity.",
