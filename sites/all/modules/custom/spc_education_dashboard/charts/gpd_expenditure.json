These commitments are well reflected in the Incheon Declaration and Education 2030 Framework for Action endorsed by the UNESCO member states in 2015...”",

    "rationale":"A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries.",
