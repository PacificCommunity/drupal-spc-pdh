    "rationale":"Rate of out-of-school children is a useful measure for comparison across countries with different population sizes. It combines the number of children of official primary age who never attended school or dropped out, and the population of official primary school age that is nationally and internationally considered as the target population. The higher the rate, the greater the need for interventions to target out-of-school children to achieve the goal of universal primary education. When disaggregated by geographical location and gender, this indicator can identify areas or groups needing the greatest efforts.",
